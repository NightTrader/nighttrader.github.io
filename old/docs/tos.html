<p>THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER THAT IMPACT YOUR RIGHTS ABOUT HOW TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.</p>

The second key remains at all times without exception with the User.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Transitory Provisions of the Law to Regulate Financial Technology Institutions (&ldquo;Fintech Law&rdquo;) enacted by the Constitutional President of the United Mexican States (&ldquo;Mexico&rdquo;) and published in the Official Gazette of the Federation on March 9, 2018, NAOME, S.A.P.I. de C.V., states that prior to the entry into force of this law, it is performing activities regulated by it.

                                    <p>1.1 We provide an efficient, convenient and secure site for storing, buying and selling digital assets. Users deposit their digital assets to the NightTrader Multi Signature Wallet and decentralized Exchange, and, through the site, authorizes transactions to move those assets or buy and sell those assets for other assets.</p>
<p>1.2 The decentralized nodes that host the order books charge a hosting fee for both parties involved in an active exchange additionally to a minimal transaction fee to cover the mining/staking the expense of withdrawals to the respective blockchain.</p>
<p>1.3 NightTrader is a non-custodial wallet when storing digital assets. This means we do not own, control, or take custody of any digital assets held by Users on the site. When funds are placed into the order books to be sold or bought, the funds are issued by the user via a blank check which is later routed by a decentralized consensus of nodes which use a type of shamir's secret sharing and threshold key(a giant multisignature represented by single keys);</p>
<p>1.4 NightTrader&rsquo;s order books are semi-custodial. When an order is placed, the User signs a raw transaction with 1 of 2 signatures. This allows the decentralized exchange backend to complete the trade at a later time while the user is offline. It allows this backend to also update the payee many times without broadcasting and promptly clear debts to mitigate any risks of collusion.</p>
<p>1.5 All the assets are kept on 2 of 2 multi signature addresses. To perform any operations with assets, it is required to have the users signature and the exchange signature. NightTrader can not move your assets until you sign your part of the transaction. NightTrader does not keep private keys of user accounts. The private key of a user account is based on a signature password that only the user knows. This can be verified by looking at our open source website and front end. NAOME is not an owner of the exchange, it is an owner of the domain and project director. The domain redirects to github to which NAOME contracts coders to update this community driven project. The hosting fee is therefore shared between users, the developers and NAOME who helps bring it to market. There is no ICO, no security and no custody.</p>
<p><strong>1.6 </strong> <strong>NightTrader can not restore the signature password if it gets lost or forgotten. You agree to keep the signature password in a safe place otherwise your funds can not be accessed.</strong></p>
<p>1.7 Because all exchange operations are bound with transaction outputs it is a requirement that your operations have to be greater than 0.00001 BTC (10k Satoshis), otherwise fees for sending funds or debts clearance will increase.</p>
<p>1.8 <strong>Force majeure (for Bitcoin based blockchains that support checklocktimeverify and Ethereum based coins only otherwise please carefully check the manual backup method)</strong>: In case of a deny-of-service attack(DDOS) and when the exchange is forced to stop operations each user can retrieve their funds via a the time locked script within a 1 year lock time, so in cases of force majeure the user can withdraw funds after one year. For coins that don&rsquo;t support checklocktimeverify scripts (such as Monero) users must manually backup their force majeure which can be a signed nlocktime transaction set within 1 year into the future. A manual service would require backups for each trade only after funds clear. We don&rsquo;t guarantee we will deploy the manual service upon release of the exchange. Users will have to occasionally make a transaction if no account activity has happened for many months which results in a small fee on the blockchain. This is to prevent DDOS against backend nodes to double spend an almost expired timelock.</p>

<p>2.2a You also represent that you have the legal authority to accept these Terms on behalf of yourself and any party you represent in connection with your use of the Services.</p>
<p>2.2b If you are an individual who is entering into these Terms on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the power to bind that entity, and you hereby agree on that entity's behalf to be bound by these Terms.</p>
<p>2.3a We may, in our sole and absolute discretion, without liability to you or any third party, suspend your use of the order books and exchange capability of an Account.</p>
<p>2.3b Such actions may be taken as a result of a number of factors, including without limitation the failure to positively identify you after your account has reached an exchange threshold, which will be defined in Article 3, by legal demand (court order injunction), or your violation of the terms of this Agreement. We may also temporarily suspend access to your Account if a technical problem so requires. However, this will never affect your ability to withdraw funds because you have your keys. If you are owed funds that have not been cleared your only choice is to wait for the exchange nodes to clear debts to ensure security of your withdrawal. This creates a risk to the user that if the exchange does go out of service and no progressive nlocktime is archived, that could result in a loss. However the decentralized backend mitigates this risk as they are programmed to clear owed debts as frequently as possible. In any case, NAOME is not responsible for the decentralized nodes because NAOME doesn&rsquo;t possess the users funds.</p>

                                    <hr>
                                    <p>Trading digital assets is risky and you should never trade more than they can afford to lose. The following list of risks associated with digital assets and the Services is not exhaustive.</p>
<p><em>Risks of trading in digital assets:</em></p>
<p>&sect; Digital asset prices are highly volatile and trading in digital assets is extremely risky. In addition, factors beyond our control may affect market liquidity for a particular digital asset, such as regulatory activity, market manipulation, the acts or omissions of the issuer of the digital asset, or unexplainable price volatility.</p>
<p>&sect; We may also determine it is in the best interest of Users to suspend trading in a digital asset for these reasons. By using the Services, you accept the risk of trading digital assets. In entering into any transaction, you represent that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your own independent appraisal into the risks of the transaction and the underlying digital asset.</p>
<p>&sect; Our listing of a digital asset does not indicate approval or disapproval of the digital asset's merits as an investment or a technology. We give no warranty as to the suitability of the digital asset traded under this Agreement and assume no fiduciary duty in our relations with you. You must conduct your own due diligence when determining whether to buy or sell a particular digital asset. If you choose wisely, we will not share in any portion of your gains. Likewise, if you chose poorly, we will not bear any portion of your losses.<br /><br /></p>
<p><em>No brokerage transactions or provision of investment advice:</em></p>
<p>&sect; We provide an execution-only service. We do not broker transactions on your behalf, advise on the merits of any particular digital assets, transactions, or associated risks, or provide any other financial, investment or legal advice in connection with the Services. To the extent that we do post market commentary, articles, or make social media posts, the act of doing so is incidental to your relationship with us and such information may not be considered as investment or financial advice and should not be construed as such. ANY DECISION TO BUY OR SELL DIGITAL ASSETS IS SOLELY THE USER'S DECISION AND WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENT LOSS.</p>
<p><em>No promise of liquidity despite ability to incentivize liquidity at our sole discretion</em></p>
<p>&sect; The ability for you to buy or sell digital assets on NightTrader is contingent on there being a counterparty willing to buy or sell the same digital asset. We make no promises as to the timing or availability of buying or selling digital assets on the Site. We reserve the right to change, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Services at any time and in any jurisdiction, without notice and without liability. This includes, without limitation, the absolute discretion to list and de-list digital assets available for trading at any time. We are not required to provide advance notice of delisting. <strong>We will always and under any circumstances allow you to withdraw your digital assets. You remain always in control of your funds. </strong>We may however offer yield farming or incentives to users who provide liquidity in hopes to attract a larger community. These incentives would be offered to holders of coins we support and love due to their innovative and decentralized nature. These incentives would never amount to a dividend because we did not issue a coin or hold an ICO. It&rsquo;s the equivalent to paying Bitcoin traders a percentage of the fees to make the platform liquid within a range of the spread. Other similar tactics may be used such as paying a rich list of users a percentage of fees to bring up volumes. Because it comes from fees, we reserve the right to structure the payout as we wish. Incentives are not guaranteed because of the high fees on blockchains limiting the amount of outputs to a transaction. So a random selection is possible for fee issuance which can create an incentive to small traders to bring liquidity to the exchange. There may be airdrops or other incentives from the pool of fees to bring in special communities and expand the platform. None of this is guaranteed and tactics may change at our sole discretion.<strong><br /><br /></strong></p>
<p><em>No guarantee of continuous access to Services</em></p>
<p>&sect; We do not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted or secure access to any part of the Services, and operation of our site may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control, including issues with the Blockchain networks. We will make reasonable efforts to ensure that transactions are processed in a timely manner, but we make no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete transactions. Errors on individual blockchains are out of our control and developers of those chains should ensure the code security before intending to list with us. We warn users of the risk of less popular proof of work chains and that those chains may require many confirmations because of the ease of chain reorganization. We are not responsible for double spends. Users should check the number of confirmations required to decide if they want to trade on this platform.</p>

                                    <p>9.1 It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and to collect, report, and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority.</p>
<p>9.2 We will (contrary to most exchanges) never make any tax with-holdings or filings and we are not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your transaction, or for collecting, reporting, or remitting any taxes arising from any transaction. We encourage you to speak with your personal tax advisor regarding the tax implications of your use of the Services.</p>
