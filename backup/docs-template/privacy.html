However in some rare cases we may decide not to use our right for civil disobedience when we get a court order against us to which we would be forced to share information. Also we can not account for rare circumstances such as leaked information from private records. Therefore, it is our wish to fully relinquish our liabilities on the use of personal information because it would be unrealistic of users to expect otherwise.
